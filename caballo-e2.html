		<!--This is About Myself-->
		<h2 style="color:RebeccaPurple;background-color:Snow;"> Get to Know Me!</h2>
		<p style="text-align:justify;"> So a little about myself is that my full name is Ada Martha Lourdes C. Caballo. I am 19 years old and I was born on the 22nd of October 2004. I like sports especially volleyball. I used to be part of varsity but for
		medical reasons I had to quit. I am good at other sports and I can learn fast but I have to play with caution. I am quite shy... <strong>BUT I PROMISE YOU I AM CHAOTIC.</strong> If you get to know me I am probably the most confusing person you will
		ever meet. I love to make new friends but I am just awkward... so PLEASE APPROACH ME! I am not dangerous! I am currently studying in Silliman University for college  but I have been studying here since Senior High School. As you can 
		tell I am considered a local! Jokes aside I am from Cebu City and decided that I needed change in my life. </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"> The reason I decided to move to Dumaguete was because I wanted <em>independence</em>. So I was considering studying abroad or Manila but then again it was far away from my family. Another downside moving to Manila is that I do not know 
		Filipino and I do not want to give myself another problem in my life. I was having a crisis on where to go but my loving family I heard my problems and a bunch of my uncles and other family members who went to Silliman University
		that I should consider going there. So I put those into consideration on where to transfer. My family decided to have a family road trip to Dumaguete City and I fell in love with the School. We did our little tour 
		back in 2017 and I decided that I wanted to give it a shot of transferring somewhere new. Now I am a Silliman University Student and I have no regrets! </p>

		<!--This is My Goal-->
		<h3 style="color:RebeccaPurple;background-color:Snow;"> My Goal! </h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify"> My goal for this school year is to really understand what I am getting myself into. Even though I have some knowledge about some of the lessons being taught, I am still unaware aout a lot of stuff especially in my CCS 2 course 
		(what even is C!).	I certainly don't want to fail any of my courses, so I strive to do well in all of them even if I won't be part of honors. I wanna meet new people and make new memories along the way. Another goal is to always
		stay positive and healthy. I know I think low of myself and see the negative things in life more than seeing the positives in life, but I am trying to better myself to keep going in life. </p>
